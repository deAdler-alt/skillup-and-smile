## üéØ The Problem

In today's fast-paced world, young people face a dual challenge: a growing gap in access to practical, job-ready skills and a rising mental health crisis exacerbated by stress and social pressure. Resources to tackle these issues are often expensive, fragmented, or stigmatized.

## ‚ú® Our Solution

**SkillUp & Smile** is an all-in-one platform that provides a supportive environment for both personal and professional growth. We believe that learning and well-being are deeply connected. Our application is built on two core pillars:

* **üß† SkillUp Module:** A curated, dynamically-loaded library of free, bite-sized courses on practical topics like programming, financial literacy, and communication.
* **üòä Smile Module:** A set of tools to support mental well-being, including a private mood journal and our unique **"Smart Suggestions"** feature. This engine analyzes a user's mood patterns and proactively offers personalized, supportive advice and resources directly on their dashboard, creating a caring and responsive experience.

We use gamification and a clean, encouraging UI to keep users engaged and motivated on their journey of self-improvement.

## üåü Key Features

* **Dynamic Course Library:** Content is fetched live from a Supabase backend, making the platform easily scalable.
* **Secure User Authentication:** Users can sign up, log in, and save personal data securely with email confirmation.
* **Personalized Wellness Support:** The app tracks mood entries and provides "smart" suggestions to logged-in users.
* **Global Session Management:** A responsive UI that reflects the user's authentication state across the entire application.
* **Modern, Performant, and Scalable:** Built with best-in-class tools for a great user experience.
