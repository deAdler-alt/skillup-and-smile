# SkillUp & Smile 
**A web application designed to empower high school students by providing free access to skill-building education and mental wellness tools.**

## The Problem
In today's world, young people face a dual challenge: limited access to practical, job-ready skills and a growing mental health crisis. "SkillUp & Smile" addresses both these issues head-on.

## Our Solution
"SkillUp & Smile" is a progressive web app built on two core pillars:
* **üß† SkillUp Module:** A curated library of bite-sized courses on practical topics like coding, financial literacy, and digital graphics.
* **üòä Smile Module:** A set of tools to support mental well-being, including a private mood journal, guided breathing exercises, and our "Smart Suggestions" feature that provides contextual support.

We use gamification (points, badges) to keep users engaged and motivated on their journey of self-improvement.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
* **Framework:** Next.js (React)
* **Backend & Database:** Supabase
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **Deployment:** Vercel
